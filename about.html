      <h1>About This Project</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Rutgers University student double-majoring in Computer Science and
        Information Technology & Informatics (ITI). I created this project to explore
        AI privacy and user awareness—specifically how people use AI tools, what kinds
        of data they share, and whether they truly understand the security risks involved.

        <h3>Why I Chose This Topic</h3>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence tools are becoming a regular part of everyday life,
          especially for students and professionals who rely on them for learning,
          productivity, and problem solving. While AI systems are powerful and convenient,
          they often encourage open-ended input—sometimes leading people to share personal,
          sensitive, or confidential information without realizing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student studying both Computer Science and ITI, I became increasingly
          interested in the gap between how AI systems actually function and how users
          perceive their safety. Many people trust AI tools without questioning what
          happens behind the scenes. This project was created to investigate that gap
          and bring awareness to the privacy and security implications of modern AI usage.

      <h3>Project Goals</h3>
      <p>
        The primary goal of this project is to examine whether everyday users are aware
        of how AI tools handle personal data and what risks may arise from improper or
        uninformed usage. This is done through a combination of background research,
        real-world examples, and survey data collected from users.
      </p>
      <p>
        By presenting these findings in an accessible format, this site aims to serve
        as both a research showcase and an educational resource. The intention is not
        to discourage the use of AI, but rather to promote responsible, ethical, and
        security-conscious usage.

        <h3>How the Survey Supports This Project</h3>
        <p>
          A major part of this project is an anonymous survey designed to measure user awareness
          and everyday behaviors related to AI privacy and security. The survey helps connect
          technical concepts to real user habits—showing whether people understand what AI tools
          may store, what they choose to share, and what they assume is “safe” to input.
        </p>
        <p>The questions focus on three areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage patterns:</strong> how often people use AI tools and what they typically use them for
            (schoolwork, writing help, coding, brainstorming, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data-sharing behavior:</strong> whether users have ever entered personal information,
            private documents, credentials, or sensitive details into AI tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Awareness and perception:</strong> whether users believe AI stores what they type,
            whether they understand privacy settings, and how confident they feel about AI security.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          The survey results are summarized on the <strong>Results</strong> page using charts and key takeaways,
          allowing me to compare user assumptions with realistic privacy and security risks.

        <h3>Connection to Computer Science &amp; ITI</h3>
        <p>
          This project sits at the intersection of technical systems and human behavior.
          From a Computer Science perspective, it relates to how AI systems process input,
          store data, and introduce potential vulnerabilities. From an ITI perspective,
          it focuses on user behavior, digital literacy, information security, and ethical
          technology use.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining technical understanding with user-focused research, this project
          reflects the interdisciplinary nature of modern technology challenges and
          highlights the importance of designing and using AI systems responsibly.

      <h3>What This Site Is Intended For</h3>
      <p>
        This website was built as a personal research and learning project. It showcases
        independent research, survey analysis, and applied knowledge related to AI privacy
        and security. The site is intended for students, educators, and general users who
        want to better understand how AI tools impact personal data and what steps can be
        taken to reduce potential risks.
