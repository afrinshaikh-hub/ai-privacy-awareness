# AI Privacy & Security Awareness

A personal research website exploring **AI privacy, user awareness, and security risks**, built as both an independent research project and a technical showcase.

## 📌 Project Overview

Artificial intelligence tools are increasingly embedded in everyday life — from chatbots and productivity assistants to recommendation systems and learning platforms. While adoption is high, **user understanding of privacy, data handling, and security risks often lags behind**.

This project investigates:
- How frequently students and everyday users interact with AI tools  
- What types of information users are willing to input into AI systems  
- Whether users consider privacy, data storage, or security risks before doing so  
- How confident users feel about AI guidance versus their own judgment  

The project combines **research, data visualization, and web development** into a single platform designed to both inform users and demonstrate technical skill.

## 🔍 Research Focus

This website is built around a short, anonymous survey designed to measure **real user behavior and awareness**, not just opinions.

Key research questions include:
- Do users understand what happens to the data they input into AI tools?
- Are privacy and security considerations actively evaluated, or mostly ignored?
- How much trust do users place in AI-generated advice?
- Where do users feel uncertain or under-informed when using AI?

Survey results are presented visually to make trends easy to understand for non-technical audiences.

## 📊 Results & Visualization

Rather than embedding results in a report or PDF, this project presents findings through **custom charts and visual summaries** directly on the website.

Each visualization corresponds to a research question, such as:
- AI usage frequency  
- Types of information shared with AI  
- Consideration of data privacy  
- Need for clearer guidance on safe AI use  

The goal is to make research **accessible, transparent, and visually intuitive**, not buried in dense text.

## 🛠️ Technical & Design Process

This project was built from scratch using:

- **HTML** for semantic structure  
- **CSS** for custom styling, layout, and visual consistency  
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and dynamic elements  
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment and version control  

Rather than using templates or frameworks, the site was intentionally designed and styled manually to:
- Maintain full control over layout and visuals  
- Create a cohesive, research-focused aesthetic  
- Ensure the results section feels credible and professional  

The development process involved multiple iterations, including:
- Refining page structure for clarity and flow  
- Adjusting visual contrast and typography for readability  
- Improving image placement and responsiveness  
- Organizing results so they feel analytical, not decorative

## ✍️ Why This Project Matters

This project reflects the intersection of:
- **Technical development** (building and deploying a multi-page website)
- **Research thinking** (survey design, data interpretation, and ethical considerations)
- **Communication skills** (presenting complex ideas clearly to a general audience)

It is designed not just to exist as a website, but to demonstrate:
- An understanding of AI systems beyond surface-level usage  
- Awareness of privacy and security implications  
- The ability to translate abstract risks into concrete insights

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:
- Expanding the dataset with more survey responses  
- Adding deeper analysis and comparisons between user groups  
- Improving accessibility and mobile responsiveness  
- Potentially integrating interactive or animated data visualizations
