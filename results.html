    <h1>Survey Results</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      This section presents findings from a student survey examining AI usage patterns,
      awareness of data privacy, and perceptions of security risks when using AI tools.
    </p>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 1: AI USAGE
    ======================== -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>How Often Students Use AI Tools</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">Understanding how embedded AI tools are in daily academic use</p>

      <img src="assets/images/chart-usage-frequency.png"
           alt="Chart showing frequency of AI tool usage"
           style="max-width:100%;border-radius:12px;margin:12px 0;">

      <p>
        The majority of respondents (65.4%) reported using AI tools very often,
        with an additional 26.9% using them sometimes. This shows that AI tools
        are not used occasionally, but are instead a regular part of students’
        academic workflows.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        High usage frequency increases the potential impact of privacy or security risks,
        especially when AI tools are used repeatedly without careful consideration.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 2: DATA SHARED
    ======================== -->
    <div class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
      <h3>Types of Information Entered into AI Tools</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">What students are actually sharing with AI systems</p>

      <img src="assets/images/chart-information-types.png"
           alt="Chart showing types of information entered into AI tools"
           style="max-width:100%;border-radius:12px;margin:12px 0;">

      <p>
        Most respondents (80.8%) reported entering school-related information such as
        assignments, notes, or code into AI tools. More than half (53.8%) also indicated
        that they have entered personal information when seeking help or advice.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Although this information may not always seem sensitive, repeated or detailed
        inputs can still raise privacy and data security concerns.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 3: DATA AWARENESS
    ======================== -->
    <div class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
      <h3>Consideration of Data Storage Before Using AI</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">Do students think about where their data goes?</p>

      <img src="assets/images/chart-data-consideration.png"
           alt="Chart showing consideration of data storage"
           style="max-width:100%;border-radius:12px;margin:12px 0;">

      <p>
        Only a small portion of respondents (11.5%) reported always thinking about where
        their data might be stored or used. Half of the respondents said they sometimes
        consider it, while the remaining respondents rarely or never do.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        This suggests that awareness exists, but it is inconsistent and often not applied
        during everyday AI usage.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 4: CONFIDENCE & AWARENESS
    ======================== -->
    <div class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
      <h3>Confidence in AI Security and Data Practices</h3>

      <p>
        When asked about confidence in how AI tools protect user information, half of the
        respondents reported being not very confident, while others described themselves
        as only somewhat confident. Very few respondents expressed strong confidence in
        AI data security.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, while some students were aware that AI tools may store or review user
        data, many reported being only somewhat aware rather than fully informed.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        These results highlight uncertainty rather than trust, suggesting a gap between
        AI usage and understanding of data protection practices.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 5: AWARENESS VS BEHAVIOR
    ======================== -->
    <div class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
      <h3>Awareness of Risks vs Continued AI Use</h3>

      <p>
        Despite recognizing potential privacy or security risks, a majority of respondents
        (65.4%) reported continuing to use AI tools for assistance. This indicates that
        convenience and academic usefulness often outweigh security concerns.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Awareness alone does not appear to significantly change behavior when AI tools
        are perceived as helpful or necessary.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 6: NEED FOR GUIDANCE
    ======================== -->
    <div class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
      <h3>Need for Guidance on Safe AI Usage</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">Student attitudes toward AI education and support</p>

      <img src="assets/images/chart-guidance-needed.png"
           alt="Chart showing support for AI safety guidance"
           style="max-width:100%;border-radius:12px;margin:12px 0;">

      <p>
        An overwhelming majority of respondents (84.6%) agreed that students should
        receive more guidance on safe and secure AI usage. The remaining respondents
        felt that at least basic guidance should be provided.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        This finding strongly supports the need for clearer education, policies, or
        resources focused on AI privacy and security rather than discouraging AI use.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- =======================
         SUMMARY
    ======================== -->
    <div class="card" style="margin-top:22px;">
      <h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, the results show that students frequently rely on AI tools and often share
        academic or personal information, while their understanding of privacy and security
        practices remains inconsistent. Although many students recognize potential risks,
        they continue to use AI due to its convenience and usefulness. The strong demand
        for guidance highlights the importance of improving AI privacy and security education.
